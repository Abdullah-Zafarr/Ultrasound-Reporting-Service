## 2. Core Value Propositions

### 🚀 Accelerated Throughput
Automated worksheet-to-report generation cuts down reporting time by up to 60%, allowing clinics to handle higher patient volumes without compromising quality.

### 🛡️ Clinical Guardrails
Deterministic rule engines and validation layers (ACR TI-RADS, AIUM guidelines) ensure that critical measurements are never missed and findings are consistent with established medical standards.

### 🔌 Seamless Interoperability
Out-of-the-box support for HL7 export and DICOMweb integration allows Sonolynx to slot into existing hospital infrastructures (PACS/RIS) with minimal friction.

### 📈 Future-Proof Intelligence
A modular architecture designed for the AI era, featuring extensible hooks for LLM-based report enhancement and automated finding extraction.
